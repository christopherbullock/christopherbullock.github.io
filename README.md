This portfolio is designed to be a repository showing predominately professional achievements.  A goal of the page is to be able 
to update the maps and pages with accomplishments that occur throughout my professional career to showcase my ability as both a 
forester and a web map designer.

Some images are still place holders for when the task is more complete rather than just up to the standards for module 7.  My intent
is to one day include a professional picture of myself and go more in depth in the about me section.

The general lay out is designed from the Freelancer page design, showing my name, a small about me secion, a showcase of my portfolio 
(currently mostly UK MAP course), an about me section, and lastly ways to contact me if needed!

My future intents of this site is to use it as a working document of works I produce personally and professionally to allow interested
parties to know what my abilities are accurately while showing a focus in my passion projects as well.
